 What Is It?
This system gives credit scores to crypto wallets that use the Aave V2 lending protocol. The score ranges from 0 (very risky) to 1000 (very trustworthy).

How Does It Work?
Labeling Wallets

If a wallet was liquidated (lost its collateral), it's marked as risky.

If it borrowed but was never liquidated, it’s considered reliable.

If it never borrowed, it gets a neutral score of 750.

Training the Model A machine learning model (XGBoost) learns patterns from these labeled wallets to figure out what "risky behavior" looks like.

Predicting Scores The model gives a risk probability (how likely a wallet is to get liquidated). Then it calculates a score like this: Score = (1 - risk probability) × 1000 So less risk means a higher score.

What Data Does the Model Use?
It looks at:

Repayment ratio: How well the wallet pays back loans.

Current debt: How much debt it has now.

Borrowing history: How much it's borrowed before.

Single large loans: Shows risk appetite.

Wallet age: Older wallets may be more reliable.

Activity level: More transactions suggest more experience.

How Can It Be Improved?
Train on more data for better accuracy.

Fine-tune the model settings.

Add smarter features (like asset volatility).

Use simpler models for easier understanding
